Version NEXT [Not Released]
****************************************************************************************************
- Fix for removeAll method
- Updated file validation RegExp. Supports double-byte characters, prevents partial matches, better
	support for relative paths, improved matching of domains, and modified the "file name" match to
	include the extension (file.mp3 instead of file). The match arguments have not changed otherwise.
	Also used the "extended" argument to make the pattern more readable.
- Extension comparisons are now case-insensitive
- Added getAllResponseHeaders() and getResponseHeader() to XHRLoader
- Added loader parameter to LoadQueue's fileload event.
- Added support for JSONP
- Changed; Now setting the result object to any JSON parse errors that occur.
- Now allowing GET and POST requests. Pass a new values option when loading a file to send that data as a GET.  Or for a POST request set the new method value to POST.
- Fixed an issue where setting max connections on an empty queue would trigger a complete event.

****************************************************************************************************
- Class name changed from createjs.PreloadJS to createjs.LoadQueue.
- Added versions file that is automatically updated via the build process, which provides run-time
	version information on the new PreloadJS object
- Migrated to new NodeJS-based doc/build process

	into the PreloadJS object
- Added JSDocs to all protected and private methods, and expanded documentation considerably

- Changed how the XHR level is determined
- Changed how request responses in XHR are determined
- Changed XHR loading for SCRIPT and CSS tags to inject into tags, instead of reloading them
- Added tag-based loading of SCRIPT, SVG, and CSS tags. Note that Scripts can only be loaded one
	at a time to maintain load order when using tags.
- Removed XHR-loading of AUDIO tags for use with HTMLAudioElement (can not properly preload)
- Added BINARY file type and enabled plugin-overriding of types
- Added better file name parsing via RegExp
- Added CreateJS EventDispatcher support, and updated demos to use events.
- Added rawResult, which is the unformatted result loaded via XHR. Update the getResult method toreturn
	it (optionally).

	the initially requested object. The items contain a "result" property which points
	to the loaded & parsed content, as well as a "rawResult".
- Internal reorganization of entire library
- Much more thorough documentation and examples
- Moved onFileLoad and onFileProgress event/handlers from AbstractLoader to PreloadJS
