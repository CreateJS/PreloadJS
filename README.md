# PreloadJS

PreloadJS is a library to make working with asset preloading easier. It provides a consistent API for loading different file types, automatic detection of XHR (XMLHttpRequest) availability with a fallback to tag-base loading, composite progress events, and a plugin model to assist with preloading in other libraries such as [SoundJS](http://www.soundjs.com).

## Example
	var preload = new PreloadJS();
	preload.onFileLoad = handleFileComplete;
	preload.loadFile('http://createjs.com/images/404/gBot-confused.jpg');
	function handleFileComplete(event) {
		document.body.appendChild(event.result);
	}

PreloadJS is currently in alpha. We will be making significant improvements to the library, samples, and documentation over the coming weeks. Please be aware that this may necessitate changes to the existing API.
