# PreloadJS

PreloadJS is a library to make working with asset preloading easier. It provides a consistent API for loading different
file types, automatic detection of XHR (XMLHttpRequest) availability with a fallback to tag-base loading, composite
progress events, and a plugin model to assist with preloading in other libraries such as [SoundJS](http://www.soundjs.com).

## Example

```javascript
var preload = new createjs.LoadQueue();
preload.addEventListener("fileload", handleFileComplete);
preload.loadFile('http://createjs.com/images/404/gBot-confused.jpg');
function handleFileComplete(event) {
	document.body.appendChild(event.result);
}
```
